    - Run CMD (Command Prompt) with Administrative Privileges

    - In the next step use any of the following kms client keys relating to your Windows 10 version

        - Now type in command “slmgr.vbs /ipk yourlicensekey” in my case its Windows 10 pro. Here is how it will look like: slmgr.vbs /ipk W269N-WFGWX-YVC9B-4J6C9-T83GX

    - Finally press enter for command execution.
    - Type the command“slmgr /skms s8.uk.to” in order to connect to KMS server. If not connecting please try this server: “slmgr /skms kms8.msguides.com”
    - Now the final step is to activate your copy of Windows 10 using command “slmgr /ato” or "slmgr.vbo -ato"

    - If you face any error e.g 0xC004F074 during activation process then don’t worry. Please make sure you are connected to the internet.

If you are still facing the error then it may also happen if KMS server is busy or loaded with multiple requests. Enter the last command again until you receive success message like the one below.

For activation status go to Start Menu => Settings => Update & Security and then Activation
